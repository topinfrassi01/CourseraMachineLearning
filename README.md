## Types of learning algorithm

- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Neural networks

## Debugging a learning algorithm

### Plot the learning curve

The learning curve is a tool to see if there is high variance or high biais in the learning algorithm. It is implemented in exercise 5. You need to plot the cost error as a function of 'm' training examples. If the curves meet high, it means there is high biais. If the curves don't meet, it means high variance.

### Plot the validation curve

### Fixing high **variance**

- Get more training examples
- Try smaller set of features
- Increase lambda

### Fixing high **biais**

- Get additional features
- Try polynomial features
- Decrease lambda
